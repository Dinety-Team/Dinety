# Level Design
Dinety is going to use the C# code to design the music's rhythm levels design and upload the code in the Unity engine directly.
We will try our best to design some good levels with our storyline and our understanding in the music.
We will show all the free levels in this file,you are able to learn and use the code in the open source way.We are welcome you use the similar code to us to do your self-makeing levels with our authorized song and other song with our UI, but note the copyright information if you use other song without our authorized.But not for commercial use.
