**The Silent Annals of the Dimension Era**
---
Long before measurement was conceivable, an unnameable “era” opened its first page. The page was neither parchment nor stone, but a fold of existence that could not be creased. The fold quivered, and its rhythm belonged neither to time nor space, yet it shook both into being. Shards shed from the tremor drifted outward, becoming invisible strings without length yet possessed of direction—directions toward an “outside” not yet outside, an “inside” not yet inside, and toward what they themselves would soon become: dimensions. Within these directions, dimensions gradually appeared, like ink spreading across an absolutely transparent lake. Wherever their edges met, a new “measurable” was born—length, breadth, height, and countless other nameless axes were inscribed simultaneously into a silent blueprint. The blueprint had no author, yet it bore strokes; every sweep left an indelible “era-mark” across the dimensional skeleton. Marks intersected, and at each intersection a dim luminance seeped out—not to illuminate, but to outline the very concept of “darkness.” Light and darkness, thus outlined, became each other’s reflection; where they overlapped, dimension gained thickness, only for that thickness to collapse into new folds. The echo of the collapse ricocheted within dimension until it was compressed into a “silent core,” sealing every scale yet to occur. Dimension could not read the core, for “reading” also requires scale; it could only continue expanding, stretching echoes into membranes, membranes into barriers, barriers into a “dimensional path” leading toward the unknown. The path has no terminus, only proliferating directions. At the farthest reach, dimension glanced back—yet even glancing needs a “past,” and the past has not arrived. Thus the entire silent annal halts before the first stroke of scale, before the echo is flattened, before dimension takes its next step; only the core, beating without scale, awaits a number not yet written, ready to tear the blueprint open once more.
