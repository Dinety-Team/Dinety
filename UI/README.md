# UI
We are planning to use some 3D models to design and implement them in the game's UI. 
It can achieve a flipping effect if we use the model designs. 
We will use Blender to create the models and integrate them into Unity's 3D space directly, using code to carry out their operational logic. 
We mix the note hit effects with the background dexterously. Utilizing a principle similar to the ripple effect, it will leave a better impression, avoiding powerful visual conflict. It's the first try in the history of rhythm games.
