# UI

We plan to utilize 3D models within the game's UI to achieve dynamic flipping effects. 
These models will be created in Blender and integrated directly into Unity's 3D environment, with operational logic implemented through code. 
Note-hit effects are skillfully blended with the background using a ripple-inspired technique, creating memorable impressions while minimizing visual dissonance. This innovative approach represents a first in rhythm game design.
Our code ensures seamless UI model integration and decomposition, maintaining animation fluidity while reducing visual conflicts from disparate UI styles and abrupt animation transitions.

The Dinety Team is confident our UI design will deliver an enhanced gaming experience with superior visual presentation.We are persevering and determined to create a satisfying UI!
