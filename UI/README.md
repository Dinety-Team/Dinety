> This document presents **Dinety Team's core concepts, exploratory directions, and design philosophy** in the field of User Interface (Hereinafter referred to as UI) design. These principles **stem from rigorous research and innovative thinking, outlining the user experience vision we aspire to achieve.**

> **Key Clarifications:**

> 1.  **Forward-Looking Reference Value:**  
>     All design concepts, schematic proposals, and interaction approaches described herein **represent provisional exploratory outcomes**. They embody our current cutting-edge thinking and hold significant referential value, **yet do not constitute finalized implementation plans.**
>     
> 2.  **Subject to Official Release:**  
>     **The ultimate design presentation and functional implementation of all product interfaces will be exclusively determined by our subsequently officially released versions.** During development, design details may undergo necessary iterations and refinements based on technical feasibility, user testing feedback, and evolving business requirements.
>     **We will dedicate our utmost technical expertise and development resources to deliver UI solutions that exceed user expectations, striving to create fluid, intuitive, and visually engaging experiences.**

We plan to utilize 3D models within the game's UI to achieve dynamic flipping effects. 
These models will be created in Blender and integrated directly into Unity's 3D environment, with operational logic implemented through code. 
Note-hit effects are skillfully blended with the background using a ripple-inspired technique, creating memorable impressions while minimizing visual dissonance. This innovative approach represents a first in rhythm game design.
Our code ensures seamless UI model integration and decomposition, maintaining animation fluidity while reducing visual conflicts from disparate UI styles and abrupt animation transitions.

The Dinety Team is confident our UI design will deliver an enhanced gaming experience with superior visual presentation.We are persevering and determined to create a satisfying UI!
